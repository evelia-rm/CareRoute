##Pfizer Digital Hackathon Submission


This project was the Hunter College's group submission to the 2024 Pfizer Digital Hackathon. Credits go to the rest of my team members Patrick, Joyce, Ayen, Emily, Justin, and Mahin for collaborating and coming up with this great idea. Win or lose aside, this hackathon was a great opportunity in identifying an issue present in the U.S and NYC and how to come up with a viable solution. This viable solution was also bearing Pfizer's core values of courage, excellence, equity, and joy in mind.
